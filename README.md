# Space Object Crossing and Detection Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based analysis to evaluate crossing and detection events of a resident space object using:

- a space-based tracker, and  
- a ground-based tracker .

The analysis is performed over a 24-hour window starting from the tracker epoch and applies geometric, range, and illumination constraints.  
Results are validated against Systems Tool Kit (STK) outputs provided as supplementary files.
